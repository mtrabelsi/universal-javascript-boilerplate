## Simple but complete boilerplate for universal javascript

### Background

I never been satisfied from using project like (https://github.com/redfin/react-server
) or (https://github.com/zeit/next.js/), here's why :

1. If there is a bug you need to wait for them to fix it - or if you really have time then make a PR and good luck with that :)
2. Lack of features: things like CSS module and import image within react module does not exist ( or at least they are buggy )
3. Strange and non natural paradigm introduced in your project, I believe the aim of software is to make life easier and more natural way
4. You don't have much control - the framework will do the magic for you, this also refers to the **1**

### Features

- Universal Javascript ( server and front code sharing / rendering )
- Support for **CSS module** and **Import Images** into your react components
- You have much control over your configuration, simpler upgrade!
- No junky code, code really simple and can be easily incorporated into your project

### Suggestion and improvement

If you have any question or spot a bug, please create an issue I'll usually respond on few hours.
